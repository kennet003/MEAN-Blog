# MEAN-Blog
## New to the MEAN Stack?

This is a little blog project that utilizes every part of the MEAN Stack.
I made this Project to help Newcomers dissect and understand how to use
The Javascript Stack. I'm hoping that this can help people learn how to 
wire up a MEAN project, understand Mongoose Referencing, how to Route a 
RESTful API, and wire up the front end to talk to the API.Once you 
have cloned the repository and installed it you will have a nice little blog.

## Repository Requirements

To use the MEAN-Blog you need to have the following configured and Installed:

+ NPM
  * Then run NPM install.
+ Bower

  * Then run sass -watch or gulp-sass.
+ Start the sever with Node
 * node server or nodemon server.

 * You NEED mongodb to use this repository. Learn how to [install](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/)
